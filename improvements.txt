KPIS Paper - Possible improvements

# Related Work
- Depth of the Topic: Provides a focused analysis of spam detection, but lacks a broader contextual discussion.
- If there are many different techniques, where might one find a survey of them? Otherwise this is an unsubstantiated statement, and having some other methods to google after and contrast may be interesting
- Have other LLMs been evaluated as spamm filters or has that idea been discarded already as too inefficent? What is the state of reseach here?
- Related Work could use an addition of other sorts of algorithms within the rule-based and content-based filtering categories.

# Dataset
- If the Enron-Spam Dataset is from the 90s and early 2000s, how can you garuantee performance on a modern scenario? 

# Naive Bayes
- It is not specified how the Naive Bayes classifier works. Does it just classify all of the words individually and then a summation judgement is used to decide if it is spam? are specific words that flag as spam used to cut out the email?
- one hot encoding 

# Result
- In the Results section it is mentioned that 5 training epochs have been done on BERT,
 it would be nice if there is some explanation on why 5 was considered ideal

# Discussion 
- Critical Elaboration: Good critical analysis of the models, but could benefit from deeper exploration of practical implications.
    - performance zwischen bayes und bert so Ã¤hnlich, dass es unwahrscheinlich scheint dass email provider/it-org das investement machen wird.
- Future research directions could include real-time spam detection challenges or scalability issues.
 - scalability ? what about 10000 emails per seconds
- What weakpoints does the Bayesian classifier still have that your new approach might cover better?
    -> indepence of features is not given, bert can process context better ->  higher accuracy
- Discuss the trade-offs between the models more explicitly, considering factors like computational costs, 
scalability
- hybrid solution possible? further research
